<h4>Text Generator "Little Language Model</h4>
<p> An interactive language model application developed in OCaml. This model, trained on a given text corpus, is capable
    of generating word sequences based on n-gram analysisâ€”a technique commonly used in natural language processing
    (NLP). When provided with a starting sequence of words, the application predicts and outputs a continuation of the
    sequence, mimicking the style and content of the training corpus.
