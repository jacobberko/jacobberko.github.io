<h4>Text Generator "Little Language Model"</h4>
<p> An interactive language model application developed in OCaml. This model, trained on a given text corpus, is capable
    of generating word sequences based on n-gram analysisâ€”a technique commonly used in natural language processing
    (NLP). When provided with a starting sequence of words, the application predicts and outputs a continuation of the
    sequence, mimicking the style and content of the training corpus.

<h4>Search Engine for Text Documents</h4>
<p> The final product of this assignment is a search engine for text documents developed in OCaml. It indexes text
    documents by crawling through a local directory and records the occurrence of words in these documents. It utilizes
    advanced data structures, including sets and dictionaries implemented with association lists and red-black trees, to
    manage data efficiently.
