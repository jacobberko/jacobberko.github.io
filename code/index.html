<h1>Coding Projects</h1>
<br>
<h3>This Website</h3>
<p> Developed this website entirely using HTML and hosted it on GitHub Pages. This project included setting up the
    repository,
    managing version control with Git, and applying web design principles to create an effective and visually appealing
    site.

<h3>Fitness Buddy (Swift)</h3>
<p>
    The Fitness Buddy app is designed to enhance your fitness journey by providing personalized workout plans based on
    your individual metrics and goals. Users can input their current height, weight, and gym experience level, and the
    app generates tailored exercise routines to help them achieve their fitness objectives, whether it's building
    muscle, losing weight, or improving endurance

<h3>The Game of Life (OCaml)</h3>
<p> The Game of Life is a project that was coded in functional programming language,
    OCaml. The game occurs in the terminal and can be played with one player or two.
    It is themed around Cornell and Cornell-based experiences.

<h3>Satisfy (iOS/Android)</h3>
<p> Winner of the Google Change the Game Award. "Satisfy" is a minimalist puzzle game that delights in offering simple
    yet satisfying challenges. Each level tasks players with arranging elements or connecting dots to create a sense of
    order and balance. With its clean graphics and intuitive gameplay, "Satisfy" rewards players with the serene
    satisfaction of seeing each puzzle click into place, providing a calm, meditative experience as they progress
    through increasingly creative and complex levels. Early stages of development for iOS and Android.

<h3>Text Generator "Little Language Model" (OCaml)</h3>
<p> An interactive language model application developed in OCaml. This model, trained on a given text corpus, is capable
    of generating word sequences based on n-gram analysisâ€”a technique commonly used in natural language processing
    (NLP). When provided with a starting sequence of words, the application predicts and outputs a continuation of the
    sequence, mimicking the style and content of the training corpus.

<h3>Maze Algorithm (Java)</h3>
<p> Developed and implemented graph algorithms and concurrency techniques within a complex codebase. The primary task is
    to simulate navigation through the London Sewer System, represented as a graph. The objective shifts to collecting
    as much treasure as possible while escaping the maze within a limited number of steps. Emphasizes the use of data
    structures like heaps to optimize graph search algorithms, synchronization of concurrent code for efficient
    execution, and the practical application of theoretical concepts in a real-world scenario.

<h3>Asteroid Shooter (Python)</h3>
<p> This project involves the development of a unique version of the classic arcade game, Asteroids. Started by
    implementing the basic functionality of a single wave of the game, mirroring the classic gameplay. Added new
    features, such as enhanced graphics, sound effects, and advanced gameplay elements, drawing inspiration from other
    iconic shooting games like Galaxian and Galaga.

<h3>Search Engine for Text Documents (OCaml)</h3>
<p> A search engine for text documents developed in OCaml. It indexes text
    documents by crawling through a local directory and records the occurrence of words in these documents. It utilizes
    advanced data structures, including sets and dictionaries implemented with association lists and red-black trees, to
    manage data efficiently.
