<br>
<p> Driven by a deep passion for music, I undertook the challenge of self-teaching music production through extensive
    tutorials and hands-on experimentation. My dedication to mastering this skill has culminated in the creation of
    my first instrumental, upbeat album, titled "Waves." Out on Apple Music and Spotify October 25, 2024.

    cure that offers hope to millions. As nations scramble to secure the life-saving treatment, the scientist's
    influence grows, elevating him to unparalleled heights of power and prestige. But behind the veil of his success
    lies a dark secret that could shatter the foundation of his legacy. "The Cure" is a gripping tale of ambition,
    deception, and the unforeseen consequences of a single man's quest for dominance.
